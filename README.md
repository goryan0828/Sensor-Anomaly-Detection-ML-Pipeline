# Sensor Anomaly Detection ML Pipeline

## Overview

Designed and implemented a production-grade machine learning pipeline to detect
anomalies in sensor telemetry data, simulating real-world scenarios in
manufacturing and system health monitoring. The project demonstrates strong
engineering practices across data preprocessing, model development, MLOps
automation, and API deployment.

## Key Contributions

- Built a modular Python-based pipeline for anomaly detection using
  time-series sensor data.

- Engineered robust preprocessing workflows and feature extraction logic
  for synthetic and open telemetry datasets.

- Trained and evaluated baseline ML models (e.g., Isolation Forest, XGBoost)
  and logged experiments using MLflow.

- Developed a FastAPI service to serve real-time inferences via Dockerized
  REST endpoints.

- Designed an automated retraining pipeline using Airflow, simulating
  data drift and scheduled updates.

- Integrated model versioning, performance tracking, and optional drift
  detection via EvidentlyAI.

## Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, MLflow, FastAPI, Docker, Airflow (or
Prefect), EvidentlyAI

## Highlights

- Simulates a full ML lifecycle: ingestion ‚Üí training ‚Üí monitoring ‚Üí serving

- Reproducible and infrastructure-aligned: emphasizes DevOps and automation
  for ML

- Demonstrates strengths in scalable pipeline design, versioning,
  and real-time systems integration

This project implements a full ML pipeline to detect anomalies in simulated
sensor (telemetry) data. It demonstrates best practices for machine learning
infrastructure including:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing

- Model training and versioning with MLflow

- Automated retraining workflow

- Model serving with FastAPI and Docker

- Docker for packaging

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (TBD)
2. Run preprocessing: `python src/preprocessing/preprocess.py`
3. Train the model: `python src/training/train.py`
4. Start the API server: `uvicorn api.app:app --reload`
5. Track experiments in MLflow UI: `mlflow ui`
